# 📝 React ToDo App Testing Practice

This project is a practice application built with **React**, focused on learning unit testing, integration testing, and behavior testing using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

The application simulates a simple **ToDo List** and allows working with different test cases to validate component behavior and their interaction with simulated data.

## 📌 Features

✅ Rendering of a task list (ToDo items).  
✅ Adding new items.  
✅ Deleting existing tasks.  
✅ Simulating data loading.  
✅ Simulating loading errors.  
✅ Handling edge-case states: no data, infinite loading, and server error.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Vite**
- **Jest**
- **React Testing Library**
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**
- **@testing-library/user-event**

## 🎯 Practice Objectives

- Learn to write unit tests for React components.
- Simulate user interactions such as clicks and text input.
- Mock data fetching requests.
- Handle edge-case scenarios:
  - No data.
  - Infinite loading.
  - Server error.
- Check test coverage (`--coverage`).

## 🧪 Tests to be Implemented

The following test cases will be written for this application:

- ✅ Initial rendering of the component.
- ✅ Adding new ToDo items.
- ✅ Removing ToDo items.
- ✅ Displaying error messages when operations fail.
- ✅ Simulating data fetching.
- ✅ Simulating edge-case states:
  - No data.
  - Server error.
  - Infinite loading.
