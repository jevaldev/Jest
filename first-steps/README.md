# First Steps with Jest

This project represents my first experience using **Jest** for testing. It includes a set of basic functions and simple test cases to explore the functionality of the **Jest** testing framework with both **Vanilla JavaScript** and **React** components.

> **Note:** This is not intended as a complete or official tutorial for using Jest — it serves purely as a personal learning exercise.

> **Other Note:** I know that the files are a messed and they're not organized :P.

## 📚 What I Learned

During the development of this project, I covered the following:

- How to separate logic into two files: one containing the function, and another dedicated to its tests.
- How to setup the config files.
- How to configure Jest for testing React components and inspecting their rendered content.

## ⚙️ Project Setup

To experiment with Jest in a React environment, I used **Vite + React** as the base setup. Below are the commands I used to install the necessary testing libraries:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react react-test-renderer
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
```
